# The Data Modeling

When we say `Data Modeling...` this means the representation of data, whether it is stored, processed, or the results of certain operations in any application, and these data are represented in organized tables so that each table has a certain number of objects, and then the data is stored in it according to the size of this data .

#

## Types of Data Modeling in Application Programming :

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

1. SQL 
2. MySQL


### NoSQL (Non Structured Query Language)

1. MongoDB (Humongous
)

#
## Where can each type be used?

### The SQL :
It is usually used in large projects that are uploaded to more than one separate server and in need of a complex organization process so that there are no conflicts or errors and for more safety...

### The NoSQL :
The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database.

Because NoSQL databases often allow developers to be in control of the structure of the data, they are a good fit with modern Agile development practices based on sprints, quick iterations, and frequent code pushes. When a developer must ask a SQL database administrator to change the structure of a database and then unload and reload the data, it can slow development down.

## Is it possible to use two types together?

Of course in big projects they are usually used together.

## SQL VS NoSQL

- The differences
    | SQL      | NoSQL |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema| They have dynamic schema  |
    | Relational   | Non-Relational        |
    | These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage | These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage  |
    | Vertically Scalable | Horizontally scalable |
    | These databases are best suited for complex queries | These databases are not so good for complex queries   |
    | Better for multi-row transactions   | better for unstructured data like documents or JSON  |
    | Table-Based | Document, Key-Value, graph, or Wide-Column Stores |
