# Event Driven Applications
___

## Discussion

### 1. Why is access control important?

Access control is important because it reduces the risk of unauthorized access to systems, databases, site control or any other application, it is the foundation of data, network and information security. Access control is a compliance requirement for some organizations.

### 2. Describe an application that would need access control.

Access control is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users that they have appropriate access to company data.

### 3. What is a role used for?

Assign each user what his powers are in the system.

### 4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Role-based access control (RBAC): Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn’t pertain to them.

Discretionary access control (DAC): This form of Access Control was originally defined by the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) as “a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by mandatory access control)”.

Mandatory access control (MAC): This model is the complete opposite of the DAC model.  In a mandatory access control (MAC) model, users do not have the discretion of determining who can access objects as in a DAC model. An operating system that is based on a MAC model greatly reduces the number of rights, permissions, and functionality a user has for security purposes.

## Term

Term | Definition
------------ | ------------
Authorization |  Is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.
Role Based Access Control   |   Allows users or groups to have specific permissions regarding which resources they have access to, what they can do with those resources, and who manages which resources.
Capabilities   |   The access rights that are given to a role of a user.

# Event Driven Applications

## Definition
An event-driven application is a computer program that is written to respond to actions generated by the user or the system. In a computing context, an event is any identifiable occurrence that has significance for system hardware or software.

Event-driven programming is used to synchronize the occurrence of multiple events and to make the program as simple as possible. The basic components of an Event-Driven Program are:

- A callback function ( called an event handler) is called when an event is triggered.
- An event loop that listens for event triggers and calls the corresponding event handler for that event.

## Prerequisites.
Now that we have a problem to solve and we know how to solve it, let's start writing some cool event listeners and event emitters. Before we begin, here are a few things to revisit.

`ES6`: This post uses some of the latest features of JS described in this highlights of top ES6 features.

`Nodejs Net`: Since our problem uses raw TCP, we need the Nodejs net module. This module is also fully event-based which makes using it a good learning experience for event-driven programming.

`Expressjs`: We use express as the webserver although we can create one for ourselves like this one here.

`Nodejs Events`: This module will interface TCP and HTTP.
